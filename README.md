  ### What on earth is this shutter-thing doing?
  With this mod a new type of furniture is to be added. \
  For every wood type a shutter type can be crafted with \
  6 slabs, just like a trapdoor.


  It works almost like a regular door but opens \
  in the middle of the block with two opening stages: \
  half and fully opened. The shutter is placed on \
  the most distant side of the block. \
  The position is reversed by sneaking.

  ### Block States
  The two opening states are: \
  • half: only opened 90° \
  • fully: opened 180°, making it wider than one block

  
  The seccond state can only be achieved, when no block is in the way. \
  Some blocks are ignored, like plants, fences, torches and more.

  ### Connectivity and Double Shutters
  All the different shutter types can be connected \
  vertically, creating a shutter as high as can be! \
  When two shutters are placed next to each other, they \

  will become a big shutter, which has the same \
  features as a normal shutter, but wider.

  ### Redstone Usage
  Powering the shutter will open it. \
  Since 2.1.2 comparators detect a redstone signal, \
  depending on the opening stages: \
  • closed — Redstone signal 0 \
  • half opened — Redstone signal 7 \
  • fully opened — Redstone signal 15

  ### Special Shutters
  • Iron Shutter: like a iron door, only openes with redstone \
  • Gold Shutter: locks its state when powered \
    (like Supplementaries:gold_door/trapdoor) \
  • Netherite Shutter: ignores redstone sometimes (idk why) \
  • Glass Shutter: is funky transparent
